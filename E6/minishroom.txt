From: Mr. anonymous
Subject: Killer shroom file from hell

Well, here it is, just about all I know about growing psychedelic mushrooms...
Most of this information was taken from a book in the rare books collection at 
the University of Texas at Austin entitled "Magic Mushroom Cultivation", 
published in 1977 and written by Stephen H. Pollock.  Anyway, I have used the 
rice-cake method described below, and am currently growing my third batch, which
has produced some pretty potent mushrooms!  I feel the need to mention that
I'm giving you this information for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY, and I don't
expect you or anyone else to actually undertake any of the techniques I will
describe below, for to do so may violate certain laws--and I wouldn't give you
this information if I thought you might do something illegal.

Before I describe the technique I use, I'd like to say that there are many 
methods of growing 'shrooms, some more difficult than others, and I am simply
presenting the method which has worked well for me: I've never had a dud batch--
they've always fruited readily, and I've never poisoned myself or others with 
contaminated 'shrooms.  I should mention, however, that the procedure I describe
is not one which will give maximum yields of mushrooms--but it does have the
advantage that the growing medium itself can be ingested for psychedelic 
effects (see section on Storage and Methods of Ingestion).
