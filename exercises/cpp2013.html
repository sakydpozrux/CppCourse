<h1> Laboratory C++. </h1> 

Tuesdays 8-10, room 7 <br>
Thursdays 12-14, room 137 </br> 

<h3> June 27th </h3>

Lab will be from 13.15 to 15.15 in room 137. 
Try to end your tasks by this day.

<h3> End of Teaching Period </h3>

The teaching period has ended. I will continue having labs
on thursdays 12-14 in room 137, but not anymore on tuesday mornings,
at least until end of June. Try to complete remaining tasks
before then. 

<h3> Aim of Laboratory </h3>

The laboratory has two goals which are somewhat in conflict
with each other: I have to teach you, and I have to check/grade you.
The balance between them depends on how much effort I believe
you put in when you made the task. <p>

It is better that you come at the beginning of the lab:
If everyone comes at the end, I will not be able to check 
(and improve, see above) your programs. Therefore, come at the
beginning. I give you a task for next week at the beginning, so
that you don't have to waste your time while waiting.
Another advantage of working/starting in the lab is that you can 
ask questions. <p>

Tasks must be shown on a Linux computer. My experience is that
in Windows, the integrated environments are not standard conforming,
use most of the screen area for showing all the fancy options of the
integrated environment itself instead of code, error messages and output. 
I am interested in your code and in its output. <p>

If you bring your own
laptop, try to read the screen from 1 meter distance under an angle of 
45 degrees. If you cannot, you should use the computers in the lab. <p> 

Windows is designed for users who do not understand how a computer works.
In order to cope with such users, it is designed in such a way that
the user has no real control over the computer, since that only 
result in damage.
The main decisions are taken by the programs, that have too much
freedom to do what they like. As a consequence, you don't know
where files are stored, what are the access rights, what programs are
being installed, what programs are running and how much resources
they are using, what data is being sent over the internet to whom, etc.
Since for a professional this is a non-acceptable situation, we
will use Linux from the beginning.

<h3> Useful Sites </h3>

<ul> 
<li>
   I usually use <a href = "http://www.cplusplus.com/">this site</a>
   for reference about STL, but there is not much info on C++ 11 yet. 
<li>
   Homepage of Bjarne Stroustrup about
   <a href= "http://www.stroustrup.com/C++11FAQ.html">C++ 11</a>. 
   I will freely use C++ 11 in exercises, because it is already 2013. 
<li>
   The wikipedia page about 
   <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11"> C++ 11</a>
   is also quite good. 
<li>
   Good explanation of
   <a href = "http://thbecker.net/articles/rvalue_references/section_01.html">
   R-value references
   </a>. 
</ul>

<h3> Exercises </h3>

<ol>
<li>
   Exercise <a href = "nr01.pdf"> number 1 </a>.
   <a href = "linux.pdf">Basics of Linux</a>.
<li>
   Exercise <a href = "nr02.pdf"> number 2 </a>.
   You need the following files:
   <a href = "nr02">nr02</a>.
<li>
   Exercise <a href = "nr03.pdf"> number 3 </a>.
   Read this <a href = "lifecycle.pdf">this explanation</a>. 
<li>
   More about the lifecycle operators. We are going to implement
   trees in C++, in order to show that there is no need for
   esoteric programming languages. 
   Exercise <a href = "nr04.pdf"> number 4</a>. 
   You need the following files:   
   <a href = "nr04">nr04</a>.
<li>
   <a href = "nr05.pdf">Exercise 5</a> is a lot easier than 4. 
   We use class tree of the previous exercise, to build a differentation 
   program. Also, we will have a look at R-value references. 
   (There will be a systematic treatment in a later exercise.) 

<li>
   <a href = "nr06.pdf">Exercise 6</a>. 
   The main containers in STL (vector and list).
   Correct use of iterators. 
<li>
   <a href = "nr07.pdf">Exercise 7</a> 
   about map and unordered_map.

<li>
   It seems there will be no thursday lab.
   Tuesday will take place. 
<li>
   <a href = "nr08.pdf">Exercise 8</a> about inheritance. 
<li>
   30.04.2013. No Lab! <br> 
   02.05.2013. Also no lab. <br> 

<li>
   <a href = "nr09.pdf">Exercise 9</a> about the
   15-puzzle. 
   <a href = "fifteen.cpp">This</a> is additional code that you
   need for the task. 

<li>
   <a href = "nr10.pdf">Exercise 10</a> about templates.

<li>
   <a href = "nr11.pdf">Exercise 11</a> about 
   Conway's <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">
   Game of Life
   </a>. 

<li>
   <a href ="nr12.pdf">Exercise 12</a> about
   <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube">Rubik's Cube</a>.
  
   You need <a href = "rubik/assert.h"> assert.h </a>,
   <a href = "rubik/rubik.cpp"> rubik.cpp </a>,
   <a href = "rubik/rotation.h"> rotation.h </a>,
   <a href = "rubik/sequence.h"> sequence.h </a>,
   <a href = "rubik/sequence.cpp"> sequence.cpp </a>,
   <a href = "rubik/cube.h"> cube.h </a>,
   and
   <a href = "rubik/cube.cpp"> cube.cpp </a>.

   <a href = "rubik/explanation.pdf"> This file </a> contains explanation
   of the notation that I use for rotations of the cube.

   If you want to plot the state of a cube, you need switch on
   the #if-s in the code, and use the
   <a href = "rubik/Makefile2"> following makefile </a>.
   It works in room 7, and will work on room 137. 
   If you don't want to use graphics, use
   <a href = "rubik/Makefile"> this makefile </a>.

   This is the last task.
